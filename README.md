# README #

This is Atac-C's source code and binary files. Atac-C is a video game created for 
celebrating ETE (now ETEC) Lauro Gomes 30th anniversary.

### How to compile ###

The game was written in C. In order to compile it, Turbo C 2.0 is available for free at Embarcadero's [website](http://edn.embarcadero.com/article/20841). 

Just open the "OG.C" file. The best memory model for this game is *medium* or higher.

### Running the game ###

You will need a proper x86 MS-DOS environment. [DOSBox](http://dosbox.sourceforge.net) is highly recommended and it can be used to run Turbo C as well.

### History ###

This game was created by a team of three people. I was the main programmer, but my friends Roger and Ricardo helped by giving some advice and testing the game. The original source code was lost, but thanks to my friend Leandro, the IDA Pro Free Disassembler and two weeks of reverse engineering magic, I managed to create a 100% compatible source file.

### License ###

Err... the original license was something like "All rights reserved ... to the Data Processing 2nd O's students and to ETE Lauro Gomes for its 30th anniversary". 

At first I was thinking about the MIT License. However I'm still deciding which license will fit better for this project.
